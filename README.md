# Static Web App Template for Nodejs

This is a minimal Nodejs application.
A basic Nodejs application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `server.js` - Starts the http server and listening the request.
- `public/index.html` - A start page of the Nodejs server.
